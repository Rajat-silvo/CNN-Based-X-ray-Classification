# CNN-Based-X-ray-Classification

● Developed a CNN-based medical imaging system using TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV to classify chest X-rays into Normal, Covid-19, and Pneumonia categories, achieving 93% accuracy.
● Actualized data preprocessing and augmentation techniques using Sklearn and OpenCV to enhance model robustness
and generalization on limited medical datasets.
● Built and optimized the deep learning pipeline integrating Keras, TensorFlow, and Sklearn for model training and reallife medical diagnosis assistance.
